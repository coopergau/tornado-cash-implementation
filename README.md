# Tornado Cash Implementation

## Description

This project is based on the private transaction protocol outlined in the [Tornado Cash Privacy Solution Version 1.4](https://berkeley-defi.github.io/assets/material/Tornado%20Cash%20Whitepaper.pdf) whitepaper by Alexey Pertsev, Roman Semenov, and Roman Storm. The protocol enhances privacy for on-chain transactions by allowing users to anonymously deposit and withdraw Ether, breaking the link between account addresses. This is achieved through the use of Merkle trees and zk-SNARKs.
