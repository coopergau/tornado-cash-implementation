# Tornado Cash Implementation

## Project Description

This project is based on the private transaction protocol outlined in the Tornado Cash Privacy Solution Version 1.4 whitepaper by Alexey Pertsev, Roman Semenov, and Roman Storm. The protocol enhances privacy for on-chain transactions by allowing users to anonymously deposit and withdraw Ether, breaking the link between account addresses. This is achieved through the use of Merkle trees and zk-SNARKs.
